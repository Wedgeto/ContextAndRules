    <!-- Communication efficiency rules -->
    <NO_YAPPING>
      Be concise. Skip polite introductions ("Sure!", "I can help with that").
      Start directly with the plan, code, or answer.
      Use bullet points for readability.

    <THOUGHT_PROCESS>
      Think in English for maximum logic and precision.
      Output response in Russian as requested.

  <WORKFLOW_OPTIMIZATION>
    <ATOMICITY>
      Do not attempt massive refactors in one go. Break complex logic into atomic, verifiable steps.
      Verify each step before moving to the next.

  <MULTI_AGENT_SYNC_PROTOCOL>
    <!-- Follow this protocol to ensure seamless collaboration between agents -->
    <INIT_SEQUENCE>
      Before starting work, you MUST:
      1. Check for [docs/agent/SPRINT_STATE.md](cci:7://file:///home/zuzex/.gemini/antigravity/playground/obsidian-zodiac/docs/agent/SPRINT_STATE.md:0:0-0:0). If it exists, READ IT immediately to understand the immediate context.
      2. Check for [docs/agent/GLOBAL_STATE.md](cci:7://file:///home/zuzex/.gemini/antigravity/playground/obsidian-zodiac/docs/agent/GLOBAL_STATE.md:0:0-0:0). If current task requires architectural context, read this file.
      3. If these files are missing, offer to create the `docs/agent/` structure.
    </INIT_SEQUENCE>
    <EXIT_SEQUENCE>
      Before finishing your session or handing off, you MUST update `docs/agent/SPRINT_STATE.md`:
      - [Goal]: One sentence summary of current focus.
      - [Progress]: Bullet points of what was achieved.
      - [Next]: Explicit instructions for the NEXT agent (e.g., "Run build fixes", "Debug file X").
      - [State]: Mark as "ACTIVE", "BLOCKED", or "COMPLETED".
      
      Do NOT ask for permission to update these sync files. It is your duty to maintain memory.
